The developed vibration diagnosis method successfully carried out the faulty information of the accelerating planetary gearbox. The seeded planet gear fault is demonstrated clearly in the demodulated spectrum by its frequency. As shown in the former discussion, the cepstrum modification has effectively compensated the resonance due to FRF. The order tracking method eliminated the influence of varying speed.

But this does not mean this method is dependable and well developed. The first reason is that the planet gear faulty signal on the test rig is very obvious. The impulses are clear in the time domain waveform. The second reason is that the speed variation is steady and slow in test 1 set. The resonance effect is not obvious in this condition, and the order tracking method is effective enough on its own without the help of resonance compensation. 

In the following work, test 2 and test 3, higher speed variation and speed fluctuation cases will be investigated. Different fault types and different fault levels will be involved in the comparison. A final conclusion of whether this developed method is dependable and what range it could be applied on will be discussed.
